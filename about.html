                    SGlow is a cosmetics studio based in Stuttgart providing services such as microneedling and BB glow.
                    <br><br>
                    SGlow was established in the September of 2024 and since then our main focus has been offering our clients 
                    high-quality certified services. It was established because I, as the owner, also had issues with my skin and after
                    going to a microneedling and BB glow treatment I decided that I could also start doing that myself. 
                    <br><br>
                    After finishing my Ausbuildung and courses learning about these procedures and how to do them properly I decided it 
                    was time to fulfill my dream and open my own studio as I was always interested in cosmetics and facial treatments. 
                
                    <br><br>
                    Clients' satisfaction and feedback is very important for us which is why you can fill out the form at the end of the page about
