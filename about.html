                    SGlow is a cosmetics studio based in Stuttgart providing services such as microneedling and BB glow.
                    <br><br>
                    SGlow was established in the September of 2024 and since then our main focus has been offering our clients 
                    high-quality certified services. It was established because I, as the owner, also had issues with my skin and after
                    going to a microneedling and BB glow treatment I decided that I could also start doing that myself. 
                    <br><br>
                    After finishing my Ausbuildung and courses learning about these procedures and how to do them properly I decided it 
                    was time to fulfill my dream and open my own studio as I was always interested in cosmetics and facial treatments. 
                
                    <br><br>
                    Clients' satisfaction and feedback is very important for us which is why you can fill out the form at the end of the page about 
                    your experience or if you have any questions regarding our services.
